        A Little <br/> About Me.
      </h1>
      <h4>
      I'm a frontend developer with a strong foundation 
      in graphic design, driven by a desire to create 
      impactful solutions for businesses. 
      Realizing the power of websites to elevate brands, 
      I ventured into web development and found my true
      passion in crafting sleek, user-focused interfaces. 
      While I continuously expand my tech skills, my heart 
      remains deeply rooted in frontend development.
